# Tic Tac Toe

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built with **React**. It implements game state management, history tracking, and winner calculation.

> This project was based on the official React tutorial ([react.dev tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)), but I wrote the code.

## Features

- Playable two-player game (X and O)
- Game history timeline with ability to "time travel" to previous turns
- Winner and tie detection
- Clear, minimal UI built with functional components and hooks
